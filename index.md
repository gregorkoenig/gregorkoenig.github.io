  Hi, I am a professional, self-motivated, and open-minded person with experience as `engineering manager`, `software engineer`, international `project manager`, and `lecturer`. I am passionate about technology and developing amazing solutions together with like-minded people. 

  My technological focus lies on the research and development of secure communication and connectivity, (bio-)signal-processing, safety-critical embedded real-time systems, and their application in different fields. 

  # Professional Career

  Currently I work as an `engineering lead` at `Barracuda Networks` in Vienna, Austria.
