  Hi, I am a professional, self-motivated, and open-minded person with experience as `engineering manager`, `software engineer`, international `project manager`, and `lecturer`. I am passionate about technology and developing amazing solutions together with like-minded people. It is highly rewarding to support people in their professional journey and help them grown, thrive, and prosper.

  My technological focus lies on the research and development of secure communication and connectivity, (bio-)signal-processing, safety-critical embedded real-time systems, and their application in different fields. 

  Currently I work as an `engineering lead` at `Barracuda Networks` in Vienna, Austria.

  I love `science` and I hold a `PhD` in Biomedical Engineering from the `Medical Univerity of Vienna` and a `MSc` in Computer Science from the Univerity of Salzburg.

  I am a founding member of the [Feigenhain Initiative](https://feigenhain.org){:target="_blank"}, a non-governmental non-profit organisation registered in France, with activities in Brazil, France and Austria. Our campaigns focus on humanitarian aid and cooperation, protection of the natural environment.
