  Hi, I am a professional, self-motivated, and open-minded person with experience as `engineering manager`, `software engineer`, international `project manager`, and `lecturer`. I am passionate about technology and developing amazing solutions together with like-minded people. 


  My core competencies as engineering and people manager lie in creating `trustful spaces` to `enable people` to develop their professional careers, strive in their roles, and live up to their full potential. This establishes a basis for to `successfully deliver outcomes` with teams and internal as well as external peers.


  Currently I work as an `engineering manager` at `Barracuda Networks` in Vienna, Austria, where I lead a team of talented engineers who develop the CG Firewall Control Center, a central component of the market-leading CG Firewall product for globally distributed large-scale enterprise networks.
