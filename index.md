  Hi, I am a professional, self-motivated, and open-minded person with experience as `engineering manager`, `software engineer`, international `project manager`, and `lecturer`. I am passionate about technology and developing amazing solutions together with like-minded people. 

  My technological focus lies on the research and development of secure communication and connectivity, (bio-)signal-processing, safety-critical embedded real-time systems, and their application in different fields. 

  
  Currently I work as an `engineering lead` at `Barracuda Networks` in Vienna, Austria.

  I love `science` and I hold a `PhD` in Biomedical Engineering from the `Medical Univerity of Vienna` and a `MSc` in Computer Science from the Univerity of Salzburg.

  I am a founding member of the [Feigenhain Initiative](https://feigenhain.org){:target="_blank"}, a non-governmental non-profit organisation registered in France, with activities in Brazil, France and Austria. Our campaigns focus on humanitarian aid and cooperation, protection of the natural environment.
